# Chapter 2

In this chapter we talk about programing: ideas on how to be better at it; structures and basic building blocks; and approaches.

We will look at two methods to express your approach to solving a problem.
1 pseudocode - natural language description, in a language like english
2 flow chart
  * rectangles for steps in the solution
  * diamonds for decisions that need to be made
  * arrows going from one shape to another to direct the flow of the answer.
  
If the steps you put together will lead to a solution to the problem, then you have an algorithm for it.

How do you know if it leads to a solution?  You have to know what the solution looks like before you can figure out how to get there.
  * Planning a trip: where to, for how long, for what goal?
  
Problem:
  You are part of an organization where the members do not see each other all that often, however some members are willing to meet up.  You know who these pairs are.  How long will it take you to get a message out to all the members about the next meeting, if you want the message to be hand delivered to everyone?
  * Graph
  * time
  * plan
  
  Start this with pseudocode
